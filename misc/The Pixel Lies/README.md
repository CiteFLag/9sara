**Description**  

Our cybersecurity team recently intercepted a suspicious image that appears completely corrupted. We believe this file contains hidden intelligence that was being transmitted between enemy operatives. 

> Initial analysis reveals something odd about the file - while it looks like random noise, our specialists noticed a peculiar pattern in how the bits are organized. They suspect some kind of steganography technique is being used, but they haven't been able to extract the hidden message yet.
>
> We need you to analyze this corrupted image and recover the hidden data.
